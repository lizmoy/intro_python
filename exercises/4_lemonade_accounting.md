## Application and Numbers Recap: Lemonade Accounting

Prompt the user for how many lemonades he/she sold and over how many hours. Use code to print out how much profit the user made, as well as the user's average hourly income.

You can use e.g. `name = input("What is your name?")` to capture dynamic input form the command line user.

Assume the following:
- It takes 4 lemons to make a lemonade
- Each lemon costs 50 cents
- Cost of the lemons is your only expense
- You're selling each lemonade for $5
- When prompted, the user will input valid integer values
