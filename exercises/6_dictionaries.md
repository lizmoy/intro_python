# Dictionaries

1. Create a dictionary called `class_data` with the following keys:

    - "course_name", which should correspond to "Python Programming 101"

    - "student_count", which should correspond to number of students, say 15.

    - "instructor", which should itself be a dictionary with the following keys:
        - "name" ("Henry")
        - "gender" ("M")
        - "can_program" (True)

2. Get the student count from the dictionary

3. Get the instructor name from the dictionary

4. Delete the gender key under instructor

5. Change the instructor name to "Henry Xie"
