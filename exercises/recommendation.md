# Basic Restaurant Recommender

Given a list of restaurants:

```python
["Laut", "Random String", "Chipotle", "Eataly", "Sophie's Cuban", "Chop't", "Potbelly's"]
```

- Write a function that takes the list of restaurants, shuffles the list, and one by one pops out a restaurant as a recommendation.
- How can you make it such that it never recommends a restaurant it recommended in the past two days?
